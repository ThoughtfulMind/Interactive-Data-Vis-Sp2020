                    Safety has always been a concern for general aviation pilots, so it is worth looking at the accidents and incidents that 
                    occurred over the past six decades in the United States to help determine 
                    safety performance and trends and answer the question: Is flying safer?

                <div id="intro-copy">As of the end of 2017, in the US, there were an estimated 609,306 active certificated pilots. 
                    This number has been declining gradually over the last decades, down from a high of over 827,000 pilots in 1980. 
                    This includes 174,883 private pilots. â€“ Wikipedia
